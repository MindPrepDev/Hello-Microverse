# Hello-Microverse

This ***pseudo-project*** is my first coding exercise that is aimed at evaluating how correctly I can setup my linters which is meant to ensure uniformity in coding styles as well as to help with basic syntax errors detection in my future projects, how well I grasped the concept of GitHub flow in a working environment, and how professional I can be in my **Commenting _and_ Project Description**. 

> This exercise is not intended as a project. It is just a submission of an exercise, and it is my first official exercise.
